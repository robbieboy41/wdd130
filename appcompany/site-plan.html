      <h3>Who we are</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to my site because I will show specific examples of the applications that my team have created and have testimonies from people that we have helped. We plan on keeping the website clean and professional so that it attracts people the way that it is supposed to. Plan on keeping the website organized and simple to use. Plan on also making sure that we show all our pricing and information so that are visible and up front to everyone so that are as transparent as we can be. All the work we put into it should bring lots of people to the site. 
We have that they will want to come to our site and that we can provide enough information right off the bat and to make sure that we give enough about our company to bring everyone to the company.

We hope that everyone will be amazed and that they come back and give us good ratings. 
ACTIVITES
I suppose that we could have some activities to show them what kind of applications and work that we do. We could have them play some sort of game that will give them an idea of what we can do, and what we can help them with. We will let them choose a couple of different options to see what kind of affect it would have on whatever problem we presented them. We could also just have a simple form to have them enter information or an ease of contact information to get a hold of us as quickly as possible.

      <h3>Reviews</h3>
